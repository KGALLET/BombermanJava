# Project : Bomberman Game  

## This project was a Student project made by 5 people  

## Rules  

You can launch the game with 2 players

Player 1  : Z-S-Q-D and SPACE to drop a bomb   
Player 2  : Fleches and ENTRER to drop a bomb

## Execution  

In case there is a problem installing the dependencies, I made a fork of the game framework, available here : https://github.com/KGALLET/lille-game-framework

$ mvn install  
$ mvn exec:java
